Browser-based logging app

Here is an example I developed years ago, in GWT:

We're building a modernised version of the app, in ReactJS.  We're also changing the layout and focus of the app.

Instructions:
* Select Create new tab, then Create lake
* Select items from the top menu. Each one inserts a blank entry. Fill in some fields, then press OK.
* Select Utilities / Generate 50
* Now double-click on some entries, to edit them
* Select Filter / Filter. Now try to apply some filters.
