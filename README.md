# Narrative-Next
Browser-based logging app, focussing on usability and performance - particularly with high volumes of data. Try a demo version [here](https://deepbluecltd.github.io/narr-next/)

# History

I have produced several generations of narrative keeping tools, starting off with the Submarine and then Fleet Narrative Tools (SMNT and FLNT) back in the late 90s.

[Here](https://deepbluecltd.github.io/gwtListEditor/GWTDiary.html) is an example I developed back in 2011, in GWT


We're building a modernised version of the app, in ReactJS.  We're also changing the layout and focus of the app.

Instructions for the above GWT legacy app:
* Select Create new tab, then Create lake
* Select items from the top menu. Each one inserts a blank entry. Fill in some fields, then press OK.
* Select Utilities / Generate 50
* Now double-click on some entries, to edit them
* Select Filter / Filter. Now try to apply some filters.
